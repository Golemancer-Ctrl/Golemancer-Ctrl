👋 Hi, I’m @Golemancer-Ctrl, nice to meet you!
👀 I’m interested in game design, web design, JavaScript, Node.js and using code to breathe life into my own personal projects!
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Node.js, web development, game design, and much more!  I'm studying with Rutgers' Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about any project involving front-end work.
📫 How to reach me through GitHub, or at ericmarcyjr@gmail.com
